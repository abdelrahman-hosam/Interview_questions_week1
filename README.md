# Interview_questions_week1
In this series I make simulated interviews with chatGPT as a recruiter who interviews me for various poistions depending on my stack this aims to track my progress, watch my strengths and weaknesses and get me ready for real world interviews and tasks and in this week:
the job description: We’re a fast-moving SaaS company building a scalable, secure platform using Node.js, Django, and PostgreSQL, with Redis, Docker, and some microservices. We're looking for someone to own backend features, collaborate with frontend, and deploy working code regularly. We’re remote, async, and expect engineers to be independent, communicative, and technically sharp.
Points I was asked in: What’s the hardest backend system you built?
→ Showed how you handled trade-offs between reliability, scalability, speed, and security using SQL + NoSQL.

You shipped a feature that broke production. What do you do?
→ Revealed your team-first mentality, willingness to own mistakes, and process for structured recovery.

You have to send 10,000+ reports at 3 AM daily. How do you avoid overload?
→ Showed your resource sensitivity, async control, DB hit reduction, and socket management mindset.

You built a money transfer API. How do you test it?
→ Demonstrated understanding of edge cases, security layers, concurrency, and load testing.

PM asks for a feature that’ll 5x DB load. How do you explain why it’s risky?
→ Your use of analogy (football team) proved your ability to explain technical debt to non-technical people.

What’s your 3-month growth plan if you get hired?
→ Displayed maturity in how you seek mentorship, track growth, reflect on mistakes, and learn beyond just code.

And I would be happy if you drop 2 or 3 questions in my DMs on LinkedIn even if I could not answer those questions they will open to me a new way to think and search for information
